## **Summary:** 

  The protocol permits users to maintain up to 254 concurrent short records. When this limit is reached, any additional orders are appended to the final position, rather than creating a new one. A short record is subject to flagging if it breaches the primary liquidation ratio set by the protocol, leading to potential liquidation if it remains below the threshold for a predefined period.

The vulnerability emerges from the dependency of liquidation times on the **`updatedAt`** value of shorts. For the last short record, the appending of any new orders provides an alternative pathway for updating the **`updatedAt`** value of shorts, enabling users to circumvent liquidation by submitting minimal shorts to block liquidation by adjusting the time difference, thus avoiding liquidation even when they do not meet the collateral requirements for a healthy state.

## **Vulnerability Details:** 

lets take a look at the code to see how this works.
1. **Flagging of Short Record:**
    - The **`flagShort`** function allows a short to be flagged if it's under **`primaryLiquidationCR`**, subsequently invoking **`setFlagger`** which updates the short's **`updatedAt`** timestamp to the current time.

```solidity
function flagShort(address asset, address shorter, uint8 id, uint16 flaggerHint)
        external
        isNotFrozen(asset)
        nonReentrant
        onlyValidShortRecord(asset, shorter, id)
    {
        // initial code

        short.setFlagger(cusd, flaggerHint);
        emit Events.FlagShort(asset, shorter, id, msg.sender, adjustedTimestamp);
    }
```

1. **Liquidation Eligibility Check:**
    - The **`_canLiquidate`** function assesses whether the flagged short is still under **`primaryLiquidationCR`** after a certain period and if it's eligible for liquidation, depending on the **`updatedAt`** timestamp and various liquidation time frames.

```solidity
function _canLiquidate(MTypes.MarginCallPrimary memory m)
        private
        view
        returns (bool)
    {
       // Initial code

        uint256 timeDiff = LibOrders.getOffsetTimeHours() - m.short.updatedAt;
        uint256 resetLiquidationTime = LibAsset.resetLiquidationTime(m.asset);

        if (timeDiff >= resetLiquidationTime) {
            return false;
        } else {
            uint256 secondLiquidationTime = LibAsset.secondLiquidationTime(m.asset);
            bool isBetweenFirstAndSecondLiquidationTime = timeDiff
                > LibAsset.firstLiquidationTime(m.asset) && timeDiff <= secondLiquidationTime
                && s.flagMapping[m.short.flaggerId] == msg.sender;
            bool isBetweenSecondAndResetLiquidationTime =
                timeDiff > secondLiquidationTime && timeDiff <= resetLiquidationTime;
            if (
                !(
                    (isBetweenFirstAndSecondLiquidationTime)
                        || (isBetweenSecondAndResetLiquidationTime)
                )
            ) {
                revert Errors.MarginCallIneligibleWindow();
            }

            return true;
        }
    }
}
```

1. **Short Record Merging:**
    - For the last short record, the **`fillShortRecord`** function combines new matched shorts with the existing one, invoking the **`merge`** function, which updates the **`updatedAt`** value to the current time.

```solidity
function fillShortRecord(
        address asset,
        address shorter,
        uint8 shortId,
        SR status,
        uint88 collateral,
        uint88 ercAmount,
        uint256 ercDebtRate,
        uint256 zethYieldRate
    ) internal {
        AppStorage storage s = appStorage();

        uint256 ercDebtSocialized = ercAmount.mul(ercDebtRate);
        uint256 yield = collateral.mul(zethYieldRate);

        STypes.ShortRecord storage short = s.shortRecords[asset][shorter][shortId];
        if (short.status == SR.Cancelled) {
            short.ercDebt = short.collateral = 0;
        }

        short.status = status;
        LibShortRecord.merge(
            short,
            ercAmount,
            ercDebtSocialized,
            collateral,
            yield,
            LibOrders.getOffsetTimeHours()
        );
    }
```

- In the merge function we see that we update the updatedAt value to creationTime which is  LibOrders.getOffsetTimeHours().

```solidity
function merge(
        STypes.ShortRecord storage short,
        uint88 ercDebt,
        uint256 ercDebtSocialized,
        uint88 collateral,
        uint256 yield,
        uint24 creationTime
    ) internal {
        // Resolve ercDebt
        ercDebtSocialized += short.ercDebt.mul(short.ercDebtRate);
        short.ercDebt += ercDebt;
        short.ercDebtRate = ercDebtSocialized.divU64(short.ercDebt);
        // Resolve zethCollateral
        yield += short.collateral.mul(short.zethYieldRate);
        short.collateral += collateral;
        short.zethYieldRate = yield.divU80(short.collateral);
        // Assign updatedAt
        short.updatedAt = creationTime;
    }
```

- This means that even if the position was flagged and is still under the **`primaryLiquidationCR`**, it cannot be liquidated as the **`updatedAt`** timestamp has been updated, making the time difference not big enough.

## **Impact:** 

  This allows a user with a position under the primaryLiquidationCR to avoid primary liquidation even if the short is in the valid time ranges for liquidation.

## **Tools Used:** 
  - Manual analysis
  - Foundry

## **Recommendation:** 

  Impose stricter conditions for updating the last short record when the position is flagged and remains under the **`primaryLiquidationCR`** post-merge, similar to how the **`combineShorts`** function works.

```solidity
function createShortRecord(
        address asset,
        address shorter,
        SR status,
        uint88 collateral,
        uint88 ercAmount,
        uint64 ercDebtRate,
        uint80 zethYieldRate,
        uint40 tokenId
    ) internal returns (uint8 id) {
        AppStorage storage s = appStorage();

        // Initial code

        } else {
            // All shortRecordIds used, combine into max shortRecordId
            id = Constants.SHORT_MAX_ID;
            fillShortRecord(
                asset,
                shorter,
                id,
                status,
                collateral,
                ercAmount,
                ercDebtRate,
                zethYieldRate
            );

            // If the short was flagged, ensure resulting c-ratio > primaryLiquidationCR
		 if (Constants.SHORT_MAX_ID.shortFlagExists) {
	                if (
	                    Constants.SHORT_MAX_ID.getCollateralRatioSpotPrice(
	                        LibOracle.getSavedOrSpotOraclePrice(_asset)
	                ) < LibAsset.primaryLiquidationCR(_asset)
                  ) revert Errors.InsufficientCollateral();
                  // Resulting combined short has sufficient c-ratio to remove flag
                  Constants.SHORT_MAX_ID.resetFlag();
                 }
            }
    }

## **Summary:** 

  The protocol enables users to flag positions that fall below the primary collateral ratio. Subsequently, the shorter is granted a time frame to restore their position above this ratio to avoid liquidation. If the position remains below the primary collateral ratio, the flagger attains the exclusive right to liquidate it before anyone else.

## **Vulnerability Details:** 

  To optimize the process, the protocol reuses flagger IDs. However, a flaw exists in the protocol where a flagger ID is available for reuse after the firstLiquidationTime instead of after the secondLiquidationTime.

```solidity
//@dev re-use an inactive flaggerId
if (timeDiff > LibAsset.firstLiquidationTime(cusd)) {
   delete s.assetUser[cusd][flaggerToReplace].g_flaggerId;
   short.flaggerId = flagStorage.g_flaggerId = flaggerHint;
```

This premature reuse of the flagger ID can block a flagger from liquidating a position during their allocated slot, which spans between firstLiquidationTime and secondLiquidationTime.

```solidity
uint256 secondLiquidationTime = LibAsset.secondLiquidationTime(m.asset);
            bool isBetweenFirstAndSecondLiquidationTime = timeDiff
                > LibAsset.firstLiquidationTime(m.asset) && timeDiff <= secondLiquidationTime
                && s.flagMapping[m.short.flaggerId] == msg.sender;
```

https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-09-ditto/blob/a93b4276420a092913f43169a353a6198d3c21b9/contracts/facets/ShortRecordFacet.sol#L117

## **Summary:** 

  The protocol allows users to combine multiple short positions into one as long as the combined short stays above the primary collateral ratio. The function is also able to reset an active flag from any of the combined shorts if the final ratio is above the primaryLiquidationCR.

The issue is that the combineShorts function does not call updateErcDebt, which is called in every other function that is able to reset a shorts flag. This means that if the debt is outdated the final combined short could incorrectly reset the flag putting the position on a healthy ratio when it really isnâ€™t. This would also mean that it will have to be reflagged and go through the timer again before it can be liquidated.

## **Vulnerability Details:** 

  The combine shorts function merges all short records into the short at position id[0]. Focusing on the debt aspect it adds up the total debt and calculates the ercDebtSocialized of all positions except for the first.

```solidity
      {
      uint88 currentShortCollateral = currentShort.collateral;
      uint88 currentShortErcDebt = currentShort.ercDebt;
      collateral += currentShortCollateral;
      ercDebt += currentShortErcDebt;
      yield += currentShortCollateral.mul(currentShort.zethYieldRate);
      ercDebtSocialized += currentShortErcDebt.mul(currentShort.ercDebtRate);
      }
```

It then merges this total to the first position using the merge function and this will give us the combined short.

```solidity
// Merge all short records into the short at position id[0]
        firstShort.merge(ercDebt, ercDebtSocialized, collateral, yield, c.shortUpdatedAt);
```

Finally we check if the position had an active flag and if it did, we check if the new combined short is in a healthy enough state to reset the flag, if not the whole function reverts.

```solidity
        // If at least one short was flagged, ensure resulting c-ratio > primaryLiquidationCR
        if (c.shortFlagExists) {
            if (
                firstShort.getCollateralRatioSpotPrice(
                    LibOracle.getSavedOrSpotOraclePrice(_asset)
                ) < LibAsset.primaryLiquidationCR(_asset)
            ) revert Errors.InsufficientCollateral();
            // Resulting combined short has sufficient c-ratio to remove flag
            firstShort.resetFlag();
        }
```

As you can see the updateErcDebt function is not called anywhere in the function meaning the flag could be reset with outdated values.

## **Impact:** 

  A short could have its flag incorrectly reset and reset the timer. This is not good for the protocol as it will have a unhealthy short for a longer time.

## **Tools Used:** 

  - Manual analysis
  - Foundry

## **Recommendation:** 

  Call updateErcDebt on the short once it is combined in the combineShorts function to ensure the collateral ratio is calculated with the most up to date values.

```solidity
    function combineShorts(address asset, uint8[] memory ids)
        external
        isNotFrozen(asset)
        nonReentrant
        onlyValidShortRecord(asset, msg.sender, ids[0])
    {
        // Initial code

        // Merge all short records into the short at position id[0]
        firstShort.merge(ercDebt, ercDebtSocialized, collateral, yield, c.shortUpdatedAt);

        firstShort.updateErcDebt(asset); // update debt here before checking flag

        // If at least one short was flagged, ensure resulting c-ratio > primaryLiquidationCR
        if (c.shortFlagExists) {
            if (
                firstShort.getCollateralRatioSpotPrice(
                    LibOracle.getSavedOrSpotOraclePrice(_asset)
                ) < LibAsset.primaryLiquidationCR(_asset)
            ) revert Errors.InsufficientCollateral();
            // Resulting combined short has sufficient c-ratio to remove flag
            firstShort.resetFlag();
        }
        emit Events.CombineShorts(asset, msg.sender, ids);
    }
```

### Low/Info Findings

<details>
  <summary><a id="l01---xxx"></a>[L01] - Last short does not reset liquidation flag after user gets fully liquidated, meaning healthy position will still be flagged if another order gets filled</summary>
  
  <br>

## **Severity:** 

Low

## **Summary:** 

  - The protocol permits users to maintain up to 254 concurrent short records. When this limit is reached, any additional orders are appended to the final position, rather than creating a new one.
- A short record is flagged if it falls below the primary liquidation ratio set by the protocol, signalling to the user that their position is nearing an unhealthy state. The user can resolve this by modifying the position to improve its health or by paying off the short and exiting the position.
- If a user is unable to get their their position to a healthy state by a certain time they can be liquidated.
- A vulnerability exists where, under specific circumstances, a userâ€™s healthy position is flagged and can be instantly liquidated without warning.

## **Vulnerability Details:**

  - Consider the following scenario
    1. User A creates a short order, that gets matched and fills in the last short (ID 254).
    2. User Aâ€™s position falls below the primary liquidation ratio and is flagged by User B.
    3. User Aâ€™s position is fully liquidated by User B, with the flag remaining active post liquidation.
    4. Another order gets filled at a healthy ratio at the same ID but remains flagged.

## **Impact:** 

  - A healthy short is incorrectly flagged.
- If the new short falls below the primary liquidation ratio:
  - It cannot be flagged by another user until updatedAt (when short was filled) plus the reset time is reached.
  - It can be liquidated after updatedAt (when short was filled) plus the firstLiquidationTime till resetLiquidationTime even if it was never flagged.
  - Keep in mind the shorts updatedAt will be updated when the short gets filled so this will push the liquidation times up by the time diff (fillShort - flagged).
- The protocol gives users a grace period to reestablish their positions when they fall below the primary liquidation ratio, however in the following situation a user can be liquidated without warning (being flagged).
- A user is also unable to use certain protocol functionality (e.g. transfer his short).

## **Tools Used:**

  - Manual Analysis
  - Foundry

## **Recommendation:**

  - The liquidation process must reset the flag in full liquidations to ensure that users donâ€™t start off with healthy positions flagged when the another order gets matched to the last short.

  <br>

## **Severity:** 

Low

## **Summary:** 

  - The protocol permits users to maintain up to 254 concurrent short records. When this limit is reached, any additional orders are appended to the final position, rather than creating a new one.
- A short record is flagged if it falls below the primary liquidation ratio set by the protocol, signalling to the user that their position is nearing an unhealthy state. The user can resolve this by modifying the position to improve its health or by paying off the short and exiting the position.
- A vulnerability exists where, under specific circumstances, a userâ€™s healthy position is flagged and can be instantly liquidated without warning.

## **Vulnerability Details:**

  - Consider the following scenario
    1. User A creates a short order, that gets matched and fills in the last short (ID 254).
    2. User Aâ€™s position falls below the primary liquidation ratio and is flagged.
    3. User A calls **`exitShortErcEscrowed`** to pay off the position.
        1. The full amount was paid off but maybeResetFlag is not called.
    4. Another short order gets filled at a healthy ratio, creating the same short record (ID 254).

## **Impact:** 

- A healthy short is incorrectly flagged.

## **Recommendation:** 

The flag needs to be checked in all three exit functions: **`exitShortWallet`**, **`exitShortErcEscrowed`**, and **`exitShort`**, when a short record is fully paid.

Ensure the flag is reset when a user fully pays off their short, so if it was the last short a user will not start of with a healthy position flagged when a new short gets matched at that spot.

## **Severity:** 

Low

## **Summary:** 

  - The protocol allows a short order to be partially matched, generating a short record for the matched amount. The unmatched portion of the order can be subsequently filled and added to the short record.
- A short record is flagged if it falls below the primary liquidation ratio set by the protocol, signalling to the user that their position is nearing an unhealthy state. The user can resolve this by modifying the position to improve its health or by paying off the short and exiting the position.
- If a user is unable to get their their position to a healthy state by a certain time they can be liquidated.
- A vulnerability exists where, under specific circumstances, a userâ€™s healthy position is flagged and can be instantly liquidated without warning.

## **Vulnerability Details:**

  - Consider the following scenario
    1. User A creates a short order, 50% of which is filled with a bid.
    2. User Aâ€™s position falls below the primary liquidation ratio and is flagged by User B.
    3. User Aâ€™s position is fully liquidated by User B, with the flag remaining active post liquidation.
    4. The remaining order gets filled at a healthy ratio but remains flagged.

  <summary><a id="l05---xxx"></a>[L05] - Protocol doesnâ€™t take into account RETH/STETH requirements </summary>
  
  <br>

## **Severity:**

Low

## **Summary:** 

  The protocol accommodates deposits of staked ETH derivatives, such as rETH or stETH, alongside ETH, subsequently granting users a wrapped token, zETH, denoting claims to ETH within the protocol. Although the protocol allows for the minting of zETH through deposits of ETH or accepted LST, it doesn't enforce the limitations established by the LST pools. This oversight could lead to inadvertent transaction reverts, causing potential disruption in user interaction with the protocol.

## **Vulnerability Details:** 

  The protocol does not enforce constraints set by the stETH and rETH pools, leading to potential disruptions. Specifically:

**stETH Pool Constraints:**

- **On Using `requestWithdrawals()`:**
    - Every amount in **`_amounts`** must adhere to the **`MIN_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT`** and **`MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT`**.
- **On Depositing:**
    - The pool imposes a sliding window limit, determined by **`_maxStakingLimit`** and **`_stakeLimitIncreasePerBlock`**, restricting the amount of ether that can be staked within a 24-hour period.
      - Deposits reduce the health level of the protocol, progressively lowering the limit until it reaches its minimum, post which transactions are reverted.
      - Compliance with **`getCurrentStakeLimit() >= amountToStake`** is essential to avoid transaction reversion.

**rETH Pool Constraints:**

- **Deposit Availability Check:**
    - The Rocket Pool's **`RocketDepositPool`** contract mandates a check to confirm the viability of the intended deposit.
- **Minimum Deposit Limitation:**
    - The protocol accommodates deposits as low as 0.01 ETH, allowing a broader user base to earn rewards.
- **Deposit Delay (currently not active):**
    - rETH tokens from Rocket Pool incorporate a deposit delay, hindering the immediate transfer or burning of tokens by recent depositors.

## **Impact:** 

The lack of checks to these limitations can lead to transaction reverts if any of the requirements are not met, potentially affecting the overall user experience of the protocol.

## **Tools Used:** 

- manual analysis

## **Recommendation:** 

When interacting with the respective bridges, the protocol should ensure that users comply with the allowed ranges and that the bridges are accepting deposits.

  <summary><a id="l06---xxx"></a>[L06] - User can accidentally or maliciously combine the same short</summary>
  
  <br>

## **Severity:** 

Low

## **Summary:** 

  The protocol allows the merging of multiple short positions into one, provided the combined short maintains a healthy ratio. A known issue, "M-06 duplicate inputs," states that the use of of duplicate shorts is averted as shorts are deleted once combined, however it misses a sequence that can potentially bypass this preventive measure, leading to unintended or malicious  cancellations of active orders and disruptions in protocol accounting.

## **Vulnerability Details:** 

  The vulnerability resides in the **`combineShorts`** function, which initiates by validating the first short:

```solidity
function combineShorts(address asset, uint8[] memory ids)
        external
        isNotFrozen(asset)
        nonReentrant
        onlyValidShortRecord(asset, msg.sender, ids[0])
    {
```

Subsequent to the initial validation, a loop validates the remaining shorts and commences the combination process:

```solidity
address _asset = asset;
        uint88 collateral;
        uint88 ercDebt;
        uint256 yield;
        uint256 ercDebtSocialized;
        for (uint256 i = ids.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            uint8 _id = ids[i];
            _onlyValidShortRecord(_asset, msg.sender, _id);
            STypes.ShortRecord storage currentShort =
                s.shortRecords[_asset][msg.sender][_id];
            // See if there is at least one flagged short
            if (!c.shortFlagExists) {
                if (currentShort.flaggerId != 0) {
                    c.shortFlagExists = true;
                }
            }
```

Finally, the merging of the shorts is performed:

```solidity
// Merge all short records into the short at position id[0]
        firstShort.merge(ercDebt, ercDebtSocialized, collateral, yield, c.shortUpdatedAt);
```

The loophole emerges when the first short is repeated later down the array. This short is initially checked by onlyValidShortRecord(asset, msg.sender, ids[0]), it will then be combined in the loop and deleted, however the first shot is not checked again so we end up merging the total to a deleted short.

        for (uint256 i; i < 3; i++) {
            fundLimitShortOpt(DEFAULT_PRICE, DEFAULT_AMOUNT, sender);
            fundLimitBidOpt(DEFAULT_PRICE, DEFAULT_AMOUNT, receiver);
        }
        uint8[] memory shortIds = new uint8[](4);
        shortIds[0] = Constants.SHORT_STARTING_ID;
        shortIds[1] = Constants.SHORT_STARTING_ID + 1;
        shortIds[2] = Constants.SHORT_STARTING_ID + 2;
        shortIds[3] = Constants.SHORT_STARTING_ID;
        vm.prank(sender);
        diamond.combineShorts(asset, shortIds);

        STypes.ShortRecord memory shortRecord = getShortRecord(sender, Constants.SHORT_STARTING_ID);

        // check if cancelled
        assertTrue(shortRecord.status == SR.Cancelled);
    }
```
</details>

## **Impact:** 

This has two significant impacts on the protocol:
- If executed accidentally a user will lose all combined shorts.
- If executed maliciously, let's say the short is worth close to nothing, a user could reset the flag as this double counts the repeated short. The short is then cancelled and can't be liquidated.
- Both scenarios will also disrupt protocol accounting as the values are not correctly accounted for.

## **Tools Used:** 

- Manual analysis
- Foundry

## **Recommendation:** 

To fix this, the validation of the first short should be conducted post the loop execution or integrated within another validation checkpoint post-loop.

```solidity
function combineShorts(address asset, uint8[] memory ids)
        external
        isNotFrozen(asset)
        nonReentrant
        onlyValidShortRecord(asset, msg.sender, ids[0])
    {
        // initial code

        address _asset = asset;
        uint88 collateral;
        uint88 ercDebt;
        uint256 yield;
        uint256 ercDebtSocialized;
        for (uint256 i = ids.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            uint8 _id = ids[i];
            _onlyValidShortRecord(_asset, msg.sender, _id);
            STypes.ShortRecord storage currentShort =
                s.shortRecords[_asset][msg.sender][_id];
            // See if there is at least one flagged short
            if (!c.shortFlagExists) {
                if (currentShort.flaggerId != 0) {
                    c.shortFlagExists = true;
                }
            }

         // code in between
		
	onlyValidShortRecord(asset, msg.sender, ids[0]) //added check

        // Merge all short records into the short at position id[0]
        firstShort.merge(ercDebt, ercDebtSocialized, collateral, yield, c.shortUpdatedAt);

        // If at least one short was flagged, ensure resulting c-ratio > primaryLiquidationCR
        if (c.shortFlagExists) {
            if (
                firstShort.getCollateralRatioSpotPrice(
                    LibOracle.getSavedOrSpotOraclePrice(_asset)
                ) < LibAsset.primaryLiquidationCR(_asset)
            ) revert Errors.InsufficientCollateral();
            // Resulting combined short has sufficient c-ratio to remove flag
            firstShort.resetFlag();
        }
        emit Events.CombineShorts(asset, msg.sender, ids);
    }
}
```

  <summary><a id="l07---xxx"></a>[L07] - Users who are flagged and get back to a healthy ratio through price increase are still flagged contrary to the docs </summary>
  
  <br>

## **Severity:** 

Low

## **Summary:** 

The protocol allows users to flag positions that fall below the primary collateral ratio. Once flagged, if the position stays below this ratio, the flagger obtains the right to liquidate the position after a specified duration.

According to the protocol's documentation:

â€˜To halt the liquidation timer and remove the flag, the shorter must reach the target maintenance margin collateral ratio (200%) either through favourable price movements or by injecting additional collateral.â€™

However, the system does not have functionality to allow the reset of flags even when the price moves favourably, and the userâ€™s position reaches the target maintenance margin collateral ratio (CR). This discrepancy implies that, during the flag duration, users could experience instant liquidation by the flagger or any one else without warning, even if their positions had reached a healthy state after being flagged.

## **Vulnerability Details/Impact:** 

Users, even with healthy positions, may be compelled to add additional collateral, merge shorts, or invoke the exit function to reset the flag. This limitation implies that the flag cannot be reset unless users modify their positions, a condition that contradicts the stated documentation.

## **Tools Used:** 

Manual analysis

## **Recommendation:** 

Revise the flagShort function or introduce a new mechanism allowing users to manually reset the flag on their positions once they have regained a healthy state.

  <summary><a id="l08---xxx"></a>[L08] - collateral ratio can never be the max</summary>
  
  <br>

## **Severity:** 

Low

## **Summary:** 

The protocol has a maximum collateral ratio (CR) set for shorts, which is enforced in two different places within the codebase: **`createLimitShort`** and **`increaseCollateral`** functions. However, there is a discrepancy in the implementation. The code checks whether the CR is greater than or equal to (**`â‰¥`**) the maximum allowed value, thus preventing users from ever reaching the exact maximum CR value.

```solidity
function createLimitShort(
        address asset,
        uint80 price,
        uint88 ercAmount,
        MTypes.OrderHint[] memory orderHintArray,
        uint16[] memory shortHintArray,
        uint16 initialCR
    ) external isNotFrozen(asset) onlyValidAsset(asset) nonReentrant {
		...
		if (Asset.initialMargin > initialCR || cr >= Constants.CRATIO_MAX) {
            revert Errors.InvalidInitialCR();
        }
		...
	}
```

```solidity
function increaseCollateral(address asset, uint8 id, uint88 amount)
        external
        isNotFrozen(asset)
        nonReentrant
        onlyValidShortRecord(asset, msg.sender, id)
    {
		...
		if (cRatio >= Constants.CRATIO_MAX) revert Errors.CollateralHigherThanMax();
		...
    }
```

## **Vulnerability Details:** 

The use of the **`â‰¥`** operator instead of the **`>`** operator when comparing the CR with the **`Constants.CRATIO_MAX`** prevents users from setting a CR that is exactly equal to the maximum allowable CR, limiting them to values strictly less than the maximum.

## **Impact:** 

The impact of this issue is relatively low, as it primarily affects the flexibility users have in setting the CR for their shorts.

## **Tools Used:** 

Manual Analysis

## **Recommendation:** 

Update the condition to use the **`>`** operator instead of **`â‰¥`**, allowing users to set a CR exactly equal to **`Constants.CRATIO_MAX`**.

  <summary><a id="l09---xxx"></a>[L09] - Event in secondaryLiquidation could be misused to show false liquidations</summary>
  
  <br>

## **Severity:** 

Low

## **Summary:** 

  The **`liquidateSecondary`** function in the protocol is designed to emit events detailing the specifics of liquidation, which can be crucial for other protocols or front-end integrations that track secondary liquidations within the protocol. One of the values emitted is **`batches`**, which indicates which positions got liquidated. However the function emits the **`batches`** array as it initially receives it, even though it may skip positions that are not eligible for liquidation during its execution. This implies that the emitted event could represent incorrect data, indicating positions as liquidated even if they were not, due to their ineligibility.

```solidity
function liquidateSecondary(
        address asset,
        MTypes.BatchMC[] memory batches,
        uint88 liquidateAmount,
        bool isWallet
    ) external onlyValidAsset(asset) isNotFrozen(asset) nonReentrant {
        // Initial code

        emit Events.LiquidateSecondary(asset, batches, msg.sender, isWallet);
    }
```

## **Vulnerability Details/Impact:** 

This inconsistency in the emitted event data can lead to incorrect data, indicating positions as liquidated even if they were not.

## **Tools Used:** 

Manual Analysis

## **Recommendation:** 

Modify the **`batches`** array before emitting it in the event, ensuring it accurately reflects the positions that were actually liquidated.
